Name: 8Puzzle
Class: csc 447-Intro to AI
Team: Johnny Ackerman, Samuel Carroll, Ben Kaiser
Description: This program Solves 8-puzzles and has been generallized
    to solve N-Puzzles. The code uses a variety of different searches
    of which include: BFS, DFS with itteratted deeping, and A* with
    multiple different heuristics.

Usage: just run using clisp
running examples:
    clisp 8Puzzle <filename>
or from within the interpreter
    (load 8puzzle.lsp) <- this will prompt you for a series of numbers
once it is loaded
    (8puzzle '<filename>)

The <> signifies optional

Description:  This function displays a path and data about 5 different search routines run on
the toy 8 puzzle.
Parameters: optional filename - pass a puzzle by file
Return: nothing specific, don't use the return value for this function
