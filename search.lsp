                    ***** SEARCH.LSP *****

General-purpose exhaustive search routine includes both breadth-first
search and depth-first search. Uses graph search with OPEN and CLOSED
lists rather than tree search, to avoid cycles. Does not use heuristics
to limit or guide search.

To solve a specific problem, the functions "generate-successors" and
"goal-state" must be defined. "Generate-successors" takes a state as its
argument and returns a list of child states. "Goal-state?" returns T if
its argument is a goal state, NIL otherwise.

In order to retrace a solution path, nodes are stored as (state parent)
pairs, where "state" is the current state and "parent" is the parent
state. Given a goal node, a solution path is generated by simply tracing
backwards through the parent states.

Modifications: 
had to fix the termination condition so that the do loop would even run
    (repeated error of GOAL-STATE not visilbe for RETURN-FROM)
made local variable solution so that the solution was forced to be
    the last thing evaluated
